A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

Phase 1 — Authentication & Account Management


Steps to run:
1. Create a Firebase project and register Android (and iOS if needed).
2. Download google-services.json and put in android/app/ (Android).
3. Add iOS plist as instructed by Firebase (if using iOS).
4. Run flutter pub get
5. flutter run


Note: If you use the FlutterFire CLI, you'll get firebase_options.dart. If not, simple Firebase.initializeApp() used here still works with google-services.json.
